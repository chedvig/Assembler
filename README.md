#Assembler for Hypothetical Processor
#Project Overview
This project involves creating an assembler in C for an imaginary assembly language. The assembler translates human-readable code into machine code for a hypothetical processor. This project was undertaken to strengthen programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

#Features
Parsing Algorithms: Developed to interpret assembly instructions.
Symbol Table Management: Efficient handling of labels and variables.
Machine Code Generation: Creation of executable machine code from assembly instructions.
